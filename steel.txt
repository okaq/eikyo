"Art of the Steel"

To steel one's mind
became a metaphor in the early 22nd century
to guard against the theft of thought
employed by the brain hackers!


an old sci fi trope
is the vulcan in the government lab
the bureau of deciding which things are true
and which are false, or perhaps not quite true just yet
the institute of methodology, calibration and instrumentation 
in lieu of direct observation with sense perception


our cold open begins with an interruption
"your anti matter reactor can wait"
security agent and treasury officer
barge in on the scientists mid experiment
"must be important, if they sent you 
all the way out to bethesda"


i have come from the highest authority to order your lab
to stop what you are working on immediately
it has come to our attention that your invention
represents the most destructive weapon in history
while also the most beneficial discover known to man


once there was a time 
when such a device
could make an empire of the world


but at the dawn of mind
with all sentient beings free, untethered
how could such a compact be adopted


The Hyperspace Liberator


it was not merely a way to discharge psychic energy to a thinker
endowing them with brain function past the normal range


but an added side effect was summarily noted in the first trainees
an abrupt turn to spiritualism! ecstasy epiphany mystical oneness
as though the tunnel through sub space time
the wormhole to the intellect
had brought something with it
from the ethereal channel
a knowingness, a truth invisible but felt only, faith divinium
