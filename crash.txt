"The Prime Directive of any autonomous
passenger vehicle AI is: never crash!
Even if an alien space ship lands in
the middle of the road during the worst
lightening storm in a century..." -Musk


This is a dramatic re-enactment of that scene
In three parts, from multiple perspectives
Rendered 100% in demoscene style computer generated animation

Scene One - In the Lab


Logo of The Coulomb Car Company


The final TPU Neural Architecture


A trillion trillion human brains on a chip


Hard coded with 3D Maps of every inch of roadway on the planet


Instructions trained in billion simulation years


To handle any conceivable traffic interaction


The Mad Scientist in the white lab coat, 
hair and spirit disheveled like
he just composed an orchestra to play 
Stockhausen's Helicopter Quartet,
takes the piece of silicon in tweezers
and places it into the "brain" of the roadster cabriolet


A boot up sequence melodiousy 
clicks on with three
high pitched electronic notes


And the scientist smiles with the pride
of a new father embracing his forst born


Scene Two - Siberian Highway


Newlyweds on an Eco-Adventure Honeymoon


Across Trans-Siberian Tundra In a futuristic autonomous travel pod


No controls, no steering, just a HUD and voice activated concierge


Argument as old as time, a mite in the honey jar, they are lost


"Lake Baikal is to the North of here"


"No I'm certain it's to the South of us"


The climactic whirl happens a-sudden


A crack of thunder, a bolt of lightening, ozone mist rends the air


And if on a string, it descends from the cloud cover


Spaceship!


Extended sequence where they lose their heads


Scene Three - Cockpit


Not disimilar to the Pod


Few controls, invisible display, but with non human symbols


And voice control, rendered in english for clarity


"Did we mean to land so abruptly?"


"No, I told you there was a problem with The Ship's Brain"


"But The Brain is inerrant, it can never make a mistake, or lie"


"Must be this electrical discharge"


"I thought this planet was uninhabited by higher life forms"


"That's what the Data Record states. And the Data record never..."


"Enough! What's that Pod then?"


Extended Sequence


As the aliens gaze thirstily at the humans


ZOOM into the brain of the pod


The refrain "Will Never Crash" distorted sountrack


As the twin AI's meet, comingle and react
