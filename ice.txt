"What's Under The Ice"

2021-06-21


one of the oldest "saws"
in the sci fi pantheon


the intepid army expedition to 
remote antartic station
finds something alien half buried in the ice shelf


the thermite mines are arrayed in a semi circle
and what nature begun to thaw
man makes quick work of it


the cast of characters known by heart
the intro banter just as cliche as 1950s golden age
the airmen in the mess hall playing gin rummy
the radio is busted, but the base is well stocked
gamine corps flirts with distracted captain
wind and ice rages outside as patrols switch duty
trusty german shepard impervious to elements loyal friend
lab scientists philosophize over lastest issue of Nature
cooks in the mess try to gourmet-ify grade d mystery meat 


and one by one they all succumb


until its only the sole survivor is left
to stage a last ditch mental game of wits
against that which can never be killed
for how to kill that which never lived


in every previous incarnation
the thing buried in the ice
mirrored the sign of the times
cold war paranoia gave rise to ancient alien tech
modern new wave futurity to shape shifting biologics
but now the final word: it is us


as the jedi trainee enters the caves of dagobah
so in this dugout of the familiar
the team is confronted with the ultimate unknown
an ancient civilization of Edenic Man Before Corruption


and in doing so realizes the depths to which he has fallen


the thermite explosion worked all too well
after dessicating centuries the super structure lost heft
and not only ice, but a roof, caved in on itself, revealed
and into darkness down, into chambers below
as if standing on the precipice of Notre Dame cathedral


VTOLs and Frost Diriibles
the bivoauc begins, a mapping party, and the lab dwellers
exploration versus exploitation
there is glory to be had in scientific discovery
fame, fortune, immortality
they are not yet on to the fact
that one of lifes eternal mysteries could be uncovered


Who Are We?
