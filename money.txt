"World Based on Money and Intellect"

based on "bronze-level" manga from bakuman
a global system of social credit so perfected
it ushers in a new age of algorithmic determinism
and idolatry worship like a mercy-meting god of fate


influences: berserk (anime), faust (age of goethe)
the warrior as philosopher
searching for meaning and place in this world


today: we have begun the great experiment
the nascent building blocks of "the world computer"
a single blockchain, net protocol, mining pool
and turing complete language for multi-party smart contracts
every id reduced to a public private key pair
all the elements are extant for a single hive mind


tomorrow: the globe machine evolution
the electronic bus of silicon and optical fibre
could never exceed the bandwidth potential
to encode actual human thought
and so a new paradigm was born
using only infrared beams to transmit data
and encephothalic sensors to read minds
the economy moved inside our heads


of course, some brains are more highly valued than others


what is the price of an idea
born of idle hours, or concentrated focus
labor value theory of money now bunk
it is only the beauty of insight 
that is priced to the highest bidder


middlewar


but all is not as it seems
in the sub millisecond lag
between thought and transmission
there is a great filter at the edge
predicting, classifying, and yes altering
improving according to trained tastes


this is the central paradox (mystery) of the system
all thoughts are encoded on the brainchain
cryptographically signed with the owners private key
a hash of there unique cerebral fingerprint


but if the AI is acting as intermediary
who is to say where the human begins
and the cybernetic hybrid entity ends?
