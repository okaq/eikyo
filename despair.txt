since the dawn of man
students of the human psyche
in all its myriad and strange permutations
have obsessed over one question


nature vs nurture?


to the extent our behavior is instinctual
or learned and molded by social expectations


to remove a child from society
raise them on an island of wolves
deprived of language (and love)
can they, will they, thrive
is the spirit indomitable


ideally taking place during the golden age
of german high romanticism and enlightenment
the time of goethe and humboldt


oriental antecedents
he had difficulty acknowledging


the field party was in high dejune
microscopes at the ready
slides prepared, wondrous visions appeared
the hidden mysteries of high micro bacterial life


who wouldnt feel exultation
for a brief moment Nature was open to us alone
we were privy to her inner marvel
we chosen select for the transmission of prophecy


but these were not the ordinary journeymen of ways
no the plodding multitudes who let life happen to them
these were the high priests of the human spirit
in thrall of discovery, truth, beauty
a mere suggestion of the imprint of divinity
was enough to feast upon rapture for the blessed hours


and that twin
concepted in the golden light of reason
under the perfect vaulted aspect of Venus
was destined for a fate none since have experienced
