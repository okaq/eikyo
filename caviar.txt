3 months since our last short piece

this is exactly what it is
alien extra terrestrials discover Earth (terra)
and find humans a delicious delicacy


metaphorically, in the same manner we farm sturgeon eggs
directly from the ovaries of aquacultural products
and sell in fancy restaurants for high premia


part one: the exploitation


it starts randomly enough


a mapping vessel (advance class) veers off course
while avoiding a cosmic plasma storm
and discovers a habited system rich with flora and fuana
primitive stage two type, early nuclear tech, no real threat


there must be some thing useful here, to profit the corporation


enslavement!


but its quickly realized
that even minor galactic labor is too arduous for their frailty


part two: the exploration


"we've come all this way, can't return empty handed"


and so begins the science process, the probing


from the microscoping constituents of genetic material
spliced human - jellyfish - alien hybrids
glow in the dark monstrosities of no utility save novelty


to the productizing of every last morsel of food, material, energy, water


"nothing we cannot synthesize more cheaply than production and harvest"


what an ineffecient planet! even fertilization and gestation take eons!


and in an effort to discover why, leaving no stone unturned
an accidental serendipity is alighted upon


"these eggs are delicious! even raw on what they call 'toast'"


part three: the exultation


and thus, human caviar was born


a terrestrial delicacy, now expanded to galactic scale


it started like any speculative asset


different harvests were considered at auctions


then the process people began engineering exotic flavors


distribution, product packaging, and robust marketing


in all manner the great wheel of commerce turned


only forgotten was the barbarous inhumanity behind it


a tale to convert the most ardent into devout anti-vivesectionists


epilogue


in mad cannibalistic fashion


the keepers of the cult became its zealots


"to serve humans" indeed


until egg mania created a topsy turvy of all morality


and no individual was spared its infectiousness


how quickly we sell out our fellow man, and woman


even more so when in service of basic biology


until we are all rendered redundant


and only commodification of the flesh survives!


the final shot


the pearl among the oysters


from luxury food stuffs to aspirational jewelry


a gem is found in the sac


and frenzy turns to pandemonium
