"Quantum Field Theory"

the potential promise
of the unification of math and physics
the final resolution to the eternal question
"is math of mind or of body (sense)"


study in contrast between "the theorist"
pondering deeply alone in a clean flourescent office
submerged in leather bound volumes, recent papers, correspondence


and the oil streaked, rough hewn "empiricist"
contemplating the inumerable quantum experiments
deep in the steam tunnels of the particle smasher


the elementary model of qft
as a sum over many particles
a metaphor for civilation
as the sum over many lived experiences


the new insight was to re-configure
the central tenet of the "field"
rather than a vector quantity that fills space
like so many iron fillings on a white sheet of paper
a return to faraday's "lines of force"
looking down the geometry of a path, or edge between nodes


the only thing, he realized, gazing at the results
of the long running simulation finally rendered, is power
we in the scientific community lack it completely
or waste it in funding projects of leviathan scale
that produce ever more ambiguous results


it was high time for a shift in the status quo
